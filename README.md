# Jutge-Cpp
Working solutions to problems from the jutge.org platform

Collaboration rules:
 - Do it using the pull request system
 - Only AC Verdict files accepted
 - Be consistent with the following directory hierarchy: [List name]/[Problem ID][  ][Problem name]/[Approach-][n][.cc]
 - The approach numbering is incremental and is based on the order of inclusion. Higher numbers for files added later.
 - You can include header comments containing author name and a short explanation of the approach
